# Results

## Data source
For this experiment, we used a google form filled by the participant at the end of the debugging session and our observations while participant is debugging to collect necessary data to draw a conclusion. In particular, following were observed as part of data collection:

**Data collected from participants**
1. Familiarity with languages: Kotlin, Julia and Haskell prior this experiment.
2. For each Kotlin, julia and Haskell debugging experiment:
   1. How helpful compiler's error messages were for Compilation error?
   2. How readable the code is to understand Logical error?
   3. How difficult these bugs were to solve?
   4. Which programming language resembles the most to this language?
3. Ranking of relative difficulty from debugging perspective.
4. Which language they are most likely to use in near future?

**Our observations from the debugging session**
1. For each Kotlin, Julia and Haskell debugging experiment:
   1. Time taken to fix the compilation bug.
   2. Time taken to fix the logical bug.
   3. Used resources (i.e Internet search, Help from the session hosts)
2. Did the participant use traditional backtracking approach to find the root cause of the error?
