# Julia Implementation of Game of Life
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
